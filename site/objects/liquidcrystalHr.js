	motivation: "",
	description: "Central to the Liquid Crystal is the patent pending Daylight Polymer Printing Technology. By combining a high resolution LCD screen and our specially formulated polymer, designers, engineers and artists can now produce large volumes at a fraction of the cost of other 3D printers The Liquid Crystal HR is a high resolution medium format printer ideal for most general 3D printing applications. It uses our patent pending Daylight Polymer Printing Technology. Our wide range of polymers work effectively in the printer providing every possible property from elastic through to tough. It has a 196mm x 147mm x 250mm build volume, a built-in touch screen and Wi-Fi capability. Ideal for designers, engineers, dentists, jewellers and industrial prototypers. It can produce medium sized objects at a fraction of the cost of other 3D printers.",
	note: "Clear resin is not available for Daylight printers. Resin will always be coloured.",
